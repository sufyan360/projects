"""
Make a tic-tac-toe game for two players.

Write a script to play two dimensional 
Tic-Tac-Toe between two human players
who alternate entering their moves
on the same computer. Use a 3-by-3
two-dimensional array. Each player indicates their
moves by entering a pair
of numbers representing the row and column indices of the
 square in which they
want to place their mark, either an 'X' or an 'O'. When the first player 
moves,
place an 'X' in the specified square. When the second player moves, place an
'O'
in the specified square. Each move must be to an empty square. After each move,
determine
whether the game has been won and whether itâ€™s a draw.
